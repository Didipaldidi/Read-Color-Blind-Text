## About the Project

Color blindness chart detection is essential for diagnosing color vision deficiencies. This project provides a Python-based solution for automating this process. It includes the following key components:

- **Image Preprocessing:** Images are preprocessed to enhance the visibility of color blindness charts. This includes contrast adjustment, blurring, color clustering, and more.

- **Machine Learning Model:** The project uses a pre-trained neural network model to classify the processed images. The model has been trained on a dataset of color blindness charts.

- **Classification Report:** The project generates a classification report that evaluates the model's performance on the dataset, including metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
